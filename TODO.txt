Things to implement/fix, in no particular order
- Glitch classification confidence level, using the methods of sklearn.mixture.gmm
- Switch the configurations files to .ini and use python ConfigParse
- Find an authomatic method to choose the number of principal components used
    when clustering, the ideal would be finding the knee of the curve.
    This should me the point at which the curvature:
        K(x) = |f''(x)|/{1+[f'(x)]^2}^(3/2)
    has a maximum.
